People’s perception about and definitions of human trafficking vary – particularly based on whether or not they’re actively involved in fighting human trafficking
* People who are not currently involved in fighting human trafficking are more likely than people who are currently involved to think that:
     * a higher percentage of children are trafficked
     * traffickers are most often strangers
     * it is unknown or unlikely that there are people being trafficked locally to where the respondent lives
* The aggregated definition of human trafficking from people who are not currently involved in the fight to end it is: “*Human trafficking involves the illegal coercion, control, and forced movement of individuals, treating them as commodities to be traded and exploited for labor or sexual purposes, often through kidnapping, deception, or physical force.*”
     * This group is more likely to define trafficking as including transportation of people
     * This group is more likely to include feeling words – like: offensive, dehumanizing, unethical, humiliating hope, dignity
* The aggregated definition of human trafficking from people who are currently fighting to end it is: “*Human trafficking involves the illegal exploitation of individuals through force, fraud, or coercion for purposes of labor or commercial sex.*”
     * This group is more likely to define trafficking with words directly from the legal definition
     * This group uses twice as many words, on average, in their definitions
