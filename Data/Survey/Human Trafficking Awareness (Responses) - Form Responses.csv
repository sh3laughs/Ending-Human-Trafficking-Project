For what is out of the norm for me is very much the common practice or expected social norm for a community or people group. That does not mean it is excusable, but much of the conversation about human trafficking does filter down into morals rather than the general understanding that objectification of humans is the very core of trafficking. That said, stats are helpful to educate and understand, but I always weigh lived experiences as more valuable than any generalized stat because there is no universal standard for what is commercial sex versus sexual exploitation, and that gets even murkier with labor trafficking.
